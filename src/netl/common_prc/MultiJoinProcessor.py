    This is a variation on the JoinProcessor that holds all of the records on
    the right to be joined at once to a matching record on the left.  This means
    that all records will need to be received on both inputs before any records
    are released.
    
    The three key outputs are:
    
    joined: Contains each of the left records with all related right records
        joined in.
            
    left_not_joined: Contains each of the left records that was not matched to
        any record on the right input
                     
    right_not_joined: Contains each of the right records that was not matched to
        any record on the left input
                      
    To use, you must subclass and implement:
      - calc_left_join_key()
      - calc_right_join_key()
      - join_all_right_to_left()
