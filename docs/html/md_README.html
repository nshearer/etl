<h1>Workflow </h1>
<p>Encapsulates an ETL workflow</p>
<p>This class is used to organize all of the components in the workflow. It is itself a processor in the ETL Workflow, refered to as the root processor. Unlike child processors based on EtlProcessor, though, this root processor runs in the same thread as the invoking code.</p>
<h2>Definition of ETL: </h2>
<p>from <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extract,_transform,_load">Wikipedia</a></p>
<p>In computing, Extract, Transform and Load (ETL) refers to a process in database usage and especially in data warehousing that:</p>
<p>Extracts data from homogeneous or heterogeneous data sources Transforms the data for storing it in proper format or structure for querying and analysis purpose Loads it into the final target (database, more specifically, operational data store, data mart, or data warehouse) Usually all the three phases execute in parallel since the data extraction takes time, so while the data is being pulled another transformation process executes, processing the already received data and prepares the data for loading and as soon as there is some data ready to be loaded into the target, the data loading kicks off without waiting for the completion of the previous phases.</p>
<p>ETL systems commonly integrate data from multiple applications(systems), typically developed and supported by different vendors or hosted on separate computer hardware. The disparate systems containing the original data are frequently managed and operated by different employees. For example a cost accounting system may combine data from payroll, sales and purchasing.</p>
<h2>Creating an ETL Process </h2>
<p>In order to define an ETL process, the developer is encouraged to subclass this class and then define and connect the processors. This class does not need to be subclassed to create an ETL process, though, as you can just instantiate it and call the methods.</p>
<p>1) Define your processors by subclassing EtlProcessor, or using the common processors under etl.common</p>
<p>2) Call add_processor() to add your processors to the Workflow</p>
<p>3) Call connect() to connect the output ports of processors to the input ports of other processors</p>
<p>4) Call assign_processor_output() to connect the output ports of processors to an input port of this Workflow object. This allows you to define a path for records to exit the ETL workflow and be returned to the calling code. When you call the workflow. execute() method to run the ETL process, and records dispatched on the specified port will be yielded back to the calling function.</p>
<p>5) Call exectue() - Run the workflow to generate the desired output.</p>
<h1>Processors </h1>
<h2>EtlProcessorBase </h2>
<p>Base class for EtlProcessor</p>
<p>Each Processor goes through these states. The current state can be queried by the current_state property.</p>
<p>SETUP_PHASE - Is the phase before processor is started. This is the the processor starts in, and is meant to provide time to configure the component prior to starting the ETL process.</p>
<p>STARTUP_PHASE - Is the state that the processor enters while starting the ETL process, before the processor starts reciving or dispatching records.</p>
<p>PAUSED - Temporary state to stop processing</p>
<p>RUNNING_PHASE - Is the state that the processor is in while it is processing (recieving and dispatching) records.</p>
<p>FINSIHED_PHASE - Is the status the the processor is in when it will no longer recieve or dispatch records.</p>

</pre><p>Because Processors have multiple stages, and run in threads, knowing which method can be called when gets complex. Here is the convention used to keep information organized:</p>
<table class="doxtable">
<tr>
<th>Name </th><th>Desc </th><th>Called by  </th></tr>
<tr>
<td>df_* </td><td>Definition Methods </td><td>Self during setup </td></tr>
<tr>
<td>st_* </td><td>Static/Thread Safe </td><td>Anyone </td></tr>
<tr>
<td>if_* </td><td>Interface </td><td>Other Processors </td></tr>
<tr>
<td>ct_* </td><td>Control </td><td>Parent Processor </td></tr>
<tr>
<td>pr_* </td><td>Processing </td><td>Inside Prc Thread </td></tr>
</table>
<p>Each method may also check to verify that it is only called in specific phases by calling one of the _*_phase_method() methods as the first line of the method. This serves both to remember when the method can be called, and to enforce.</p>
<table class="doxtable">
<tr>
<th>Method </th><th>SETUP </th><th>STARTUP </th><th>RUNNING </th><th>FINISHED  </th></tr>
<tr>
<td>create_input_port </td><td>* </td><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr>
<tr>
<td>create_output_port </td><td>* </td><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr>
<tr>
<td>_lock_input_port </td><td>* </td><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr>
<tr>
<td>_unlock_input_port </td><td></td><td>* </td><td></td><td></td></tr>
</table>
<p>Interface methods interact with the internal thread safe queue to allow external processors (or any external objects) to send signals/records to this processor to work on. Unlike previous versions of this ETL, external objects do not push objects into the queue directly. This is to help keep the definition of the "Event" next to the handler for that event. That is, you don't have an Event object, that needs to have the same parameters as the handling method. So, in general:</p>
<p>1) An external method calls an if_* method like if_receive_input() using that methods normal signature.</p>
<p>2) The interface method describes that call with an object and queues it to the thread safe event_queue</p>
<p>3) pr_process_events() picks up that call description object from the queue and calls the pr_* version of the interface method, such as pr_receive_input().</p>
<p>+-------------------------------------------------------&mdash;+ | | | | if_&lt;name&gt;(args) +-------------&mdash;&gt; Queue | | | + | | | | | | (outside thread) | | | |-----------------------------&mdash;+ | | | (inside thread) | | | v | | pr_&lt;name&gt;(args) &lt;---------&mdash;+ pr_event_loop() | +-------------------------------------------------------&mdash;+</p>
<h2>Sub Processors </h2>
<p>While typically, only the root processor will have children processors, support is built into this base class for keeping track of children processors.</p>
<p>The parent processor of a child processor is responsible for tracking the status of all of it's children, and not considering itself finished until all of the child processes are finished.</p>
<p>In general, connections can be formed between:</p>
<ul>
<li>Two processes that are sblings of the same parent with the df_connect_sib_processors() method</li>
<li>From a parent output down to one of it's children's input ports with df_connect_parent_to_child()</li>
<li>From one of a parent processor's children's output up to a parent input port using df_connect_child_to_parent()</li>
</ul>
<p>Child processors are added to this processor by calling df_add_processor().</p>
<dl class="section see"><dt>See Also</dt><dd>EtlProcessor</dd></dl>
<h2>EtlProcessor </h2>
<p>Takes 0 or more inputs and generates 0 or more outputs</p>
<p>See EtlProcessorBase for additional detail</p>
<p>The EtlProcessor class is intended to be subclassed in order to create the components of the ETL processor. Each processor, then, performs one or more of the Extract, Transform, or Load functions in it's own thread.</p>
<p>When subclassing, you must:</p>
<p>1) In your <b>init</b>(): a) Call the super init() b) Call df_create_input_port() to define input ports c) Call df_create_output_port() to define output ports</p>
<p>2) (optionally) define starting_processor() to perform any startup tasks</p>
<p>3) (optionally) define extract_records() to extract records from external sources and output them for use by other processors</p>
<ul>
<li>Call dispatch_output() to send generated records out</li>
</ul>
<p>4) (optionally) define methods to process records sent to this component's input ports.</p>
<ul>
<li>Define pr_&lt;name&gt;_input_record() to process records recieved on port named &lt;name&gt;.</li>
<li>Define pr_any_input_record() to consume incoming records not handled by a method setup for a speific port name.</li>
<li>Call pr_dispatch_output() to send processed records out</li>
<li>Call pr_hold_record() to stash a record for processing later</li>
<li>Call pr_unhold_records() to retrieve previously held records</li>
<li>Call pr_output_finished() to signal that no more output will be sent on the named port. When all output ports are clossed, then the processing loop will exit.</li>
</ul>
<p>5) Define pr_handle_input_clossed() to perform any final processing when an input port is clossed. All of the methods available to the input handling methods are available here.</p>
<h1>EtlSchema </h1>
<p>Describes the structure of a record</p>
<p>The purpose of the schema is to assist the ETL logic with handling the fields of records when the ETL library does not know the structure of the records that will be used. I've gone back and forth as to whether to even require schemas, and whether to lock down input and output ports to schemas. Managing schemas, in my experience, can become tedious and self-serving.</p>
<p>I've decided to keep schemas though to assist with: </p>
<pre class="fragment">- Freezing records from changes
- Serializeing records to disk
- Debuging/Describing records to the user
</pre><p>I will not provide a mechanism to lock/check schemas on processor ports, though, and I don't see a great advantage to requiring this. This leaves a processor to be flexible in recieving multiple record types if desired, and leaves it up to the developer to ensure that the required fields for a given processor are present. I feel this supports the common Python practice of Duck Typing.</p>
<p>Each record, however, does need to have an associated schema. </p>
